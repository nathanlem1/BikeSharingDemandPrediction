# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

We used the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview) to develop a machine learning model to predict a bike sharing demand. 

We use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) in this implementation for bike sharing demand prediction.
